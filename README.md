# Bamazon
bamazonCustomer.js
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview: A Node scripted CLI App that takes orders from customers and adjusts inventory quantities from a mySQL database. 

App Description: Bamazon is a mock store front that allows users to choose an item according to a table of products. These same products are also stored in a mySQL database (see attached file bamazonCustomer_db.sql) and the stock quantity updates as the user purchases items. 

Tips: make sure to do an npm install locally for 'mysql', 'inquirer', and 'console.table' in your terminal! You will also need to have MySQL downloaded on your computer. Feel free to use my .sql file as a starter file and you can customize the data to your liking.
